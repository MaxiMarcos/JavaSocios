# Application for Member Management.

Welcome, this is my first Java project. It's an administrative desktop application for a football bar.

Tech Stack: Java, Swing, and MySql.

Functionality: The admin user can maintain an organized record of individuals associated with the bar (add, edit, search, and delete members). Searching for members is done by entering a name or ID, and if it belongs to a member, their details will be displayed, allowing to determine whether the person is a member or not.
